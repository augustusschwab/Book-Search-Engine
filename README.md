## Installation
To install, clone, or download the project folder, run `npm install` from the root directory followed by `npm run build`. The application uses the `React`, `Apollo Server`, `GraphQL`, and `express` JavaScript packages to allow interaction with the MongoDB database via GraphQL queries and mutations. Ensure MongoDB is downloaded to the user's machine.

## Usage
Once a root folder is set up on the user's machine and the dependencies are installed, start by initializing the MongoDB database. Then run `npm develop`, this will setup the database and initiate the server. The client side will be launched with `vite`. To see a live/interactive demo of the application, visit the link below:
