## Installation
To install, clone or download the project folder and run `npm install` from the root directory followed by `npm run build`. The application uses the `React`, `Apollo Server`, `GraphQL` and `express` JavaScript packages to allow interaction with the MongoDB database via graphQL queries and mutations. Ensure MongoDB is downloaded to the users machine.

## Usage
Once a root folder is setup on the users machine and the dependencies are installed start by initializing the MongoDB database. Then run `npm develop`, this will setup the database and initiate the server. The client side will be launched with `vite`. To see a live/interactive demo of the application visit the link below:
